                  Smart Grids generally referred to employing communication tools and emerging technologies in the existing power grids to enable two-way communication and control capabilities. The smart grid aims to optimally monitor and control the entire power grid and increase its efficiency by involving different technologies such as smart metering, renewable energy integration, distribution generations, electric vehicle and demand response. However, as a result of relying on computation, control and communication technologies, the smart grid becomes susceptible to cyber-physical attacks. Nowadays, smart grid security is crucial to achieving reliable and efficient power system operation with less possibility of power failure or equipment malfunction at High Voltage (HV), Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) levels. To be able to understand and solve the smart grid security needs and challenges, it is significant to address and evaluate the cyber-physical threats. Therefore, this project will provide a state-of-art roadmap to evaluate the resilience of smart grid systems at the three levels of voltage HV, MV and LV. In this project, the impact of different scenarios of cyber-physical threats on the power network will be investigated and tested.

                <h3>The Need for Cyber-Physical Security in Smart Grid Systems</h3>
                <p>
                  Nowadays, smart grid security is crucial to achieving reliable and efficient power system operation with less possibility of power failure or equipment malfunction at HV/MV and LV levels. In order to understand and solve the smart grid security needs and challenges, it is significant to evaluate cyberphysical threats. Therefore, this project will provide a state-of-art roadmap to evaluate the resilience of smart grid systems at three levels of the voltage network: Transmission network ( HV), MV and LV. In general, the literature focused on the HV level for investigating the cyber-physical threats without taking into account the cyber-attacks and threats on MV and LV which have more probability than HV. In this project, the impact of different scenarios of cyber-physical threats on real LV networks including the different grid components such as renewable energy systems (PV), smart metering and electric vehicle charging stations are investigated and tested. This will help to improve the smart grid system performance and the security requirements, protocols, architectures and response of the system to ongoing attacks
